%   Contributed labels in Italian.

%%%%%%
% O. Corff, July 2003
%
%   fixed one nasty spacing bug, simplified internal table
%   construction (table now has five instead of six columns,
%   the second of which was never used).
%
%%%%%%
% Johann Spies, January 21, 2002
% e-mail: jspies@sun.ac.za
%
%   Hinted that \Subtotal Project should show the project name
%   rather than just `Project'.
%
%   Contributed labels in Afrikaans.
%
%%%%%%
% Robin Fairbairns, December 6, 2001
%
%   Hinted that the dollar sign can also be printed by saying
%   \string$.
%
%%%%%%
% Vincent Tougait, France, November 27, 2001
%
%   Pointed out that fractions of VAT percents were not allowed.
%   Bugfix on December 06, 2001
%
%%%%%%
% Fred Donck, The Hague, The Netherlands, October, 2001
% e-mail: fd0@donck.com
%
% Dutch labels
%
%%%%%%
% Ian Wormsbecker, October 31, 2001
%
%   Skips the VAT lines if VAT=0
%   Noticed that the terminal message will not accept a Dollar sign.
%   The only workaround is to say \char`$ in \begin{invoice}{}
%
%%%%%%
% Fred Donck, The Hague, The Netherlands, Sept 18, 2001
% e-mail: fd0@donck.com
%
% fixed some minor issues:
%   real arithmetic will use integer intermediate values, so
%   some calculations failed with the \Fee{title}{rate}{amount}
%   where \rate is not an integer
%
%   another fix is that in my opinion the VAT line should be
%   printed also even though only one project is specified
%
%   third fix is that the subtotal-line should not be printed
%   on a project with only one \Fee line
%
%%%%%%
% Jacco Kok (fixed some labels),
%
%%%%%%
% Thilo Barth (discussed alternative names and command clashes
%	with KOMA Script class scrlettr.cls),
%
%%%%%%
% Robert Inder (discussed general issues)
%
% were gladly and gratefully received and accepted.
